## Which Neighborhood in Toronto for the Cuisine You Crave?

The goal of this project is to analyze the types of cuisine more restaurants serve in each neighborhood in Toronto and cluster the neighborhoods by frequency of various types of cuisine. Travelers can make a better decision on which neighborhood to travel to depending on what cuisine they crave.

This project requires key skills covered so far in previous courses and mainly focuses on:

* Data collection via web scraping
* Data wrangling and manipulation
* Obtaining geographical coordinates using _GeoPy_ and geographical and venues information using the Foursquare API
* K-means clustering analysis
* Creating interactive maps with superimposed markers and clusters

_Tools: pandas, BeautifulSoup, scikit-learn, GeoPy, folium, NumPy, Matplotlib, urllib, Requests, json_
