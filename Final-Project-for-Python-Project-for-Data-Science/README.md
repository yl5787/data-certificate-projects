## When Shorting Goes Wrong

Short selling occurs when an investor borrows a stock and sells it, planning to buy it back later for less money. They make profit from the decline in stock price in contrast to long investors who want the price to go up. Experienced investors such as hedge funds partake in short selling.

Sometimes short sellers get it wrong; for example, Tesla and GameStop. A few years ago, many short sellers targeted Tesla, but Tesla started becoming profitable and the company stock went up. Individual investors on the Reddit forum named WallStreetBets started buying into shares of GameStop, causing GameStop shares to soar. This produced billions of dollars in losses for hedge funds who had sold the stock short.

The goal of this project is to fulfill the role of a Data Scientist/Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm and help customers invest in stocks by extracting financial data such as historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings for Tesla and GameStop and visualizing it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends.

This project mainly focuses on:

* Stock data extraction using the Yahoo! Finance API and web scraping
* Creation of stock graphs

*Tools: yfinance, pandas, Requests, BeautifulSoup, plotly*
