## Analysis on Current Technology Usage and Emerging Trends

This project aims to provide a presentation on current broadly used programming languages and databases and emerging trends. Data was gathered and analyzed using various collection methods, analysis tools, techniques and appropriate visualizations and dashboards for analyzed data and findings were created. Then findings and visualizations were organized into a PowerPoint presentation in order to concisely present the report with adherence to the Data Analysis report structure.

This project requires key skills covered so far in previous courses and mainly focuses on:

* Data collection via web scraping and APIs
* Data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization
* Establishing connection to a SQLite database and running SQL queries on iPython notebook
* Excel visualizations and building dashboards with IBM Cognos Analytics
* Presentation of the summary of the report with adherence to the Data Analysis report structure suggested in ‘Getting Started with Data Science’ by Murtaza Haider in Chapter 3 Pg. 60-62 (Publisher: IBM Press; 1 edition (Dec 13 2015) Print)

_Tools: Requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, Workbook, NumPy, SQLite3, csv_
